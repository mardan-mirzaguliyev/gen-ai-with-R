hi welcome to my talk my name is Alber r

i Am A freelancer and A content creator

you may have seen some of my content on

YouTube or Twitter on my main job I am a

math PhD student focusing on probability

Theory but I assure you that today we

are definitely not talking about

mathematics today I want to show you how

to combine HTML and CSS with popular art

tools that you may already use to create

even more beautiful outputs than we

already have with the tools we want so

you may be wondering why is a

mathematician talking about things like

making more beautiful designs making

better tables with GT having a nicer

plot um talking about things like design

so let me tell you how I ended up here

and how the idea for this talk came to

be as a PhD student I also have to teach

and at some point I add that time I felt

like I was getting stuck with the r

course and not with the math course so

um I was sort of getting stuck with

having to teach r i ass you now I would

be very glad about this but at that time

I felt like I was kind of getting the

short end of the

stick but I decided to make the best out

of it so I uh decided to read R for data

science which I am sure all of you have

read and I just learned a lot from it

and one of the things that I found very

striking was that it starts out with

data visualization the very first

chapter teaches you GG plot and to me it

was fascinating how just the very basic

GG plot call that you learn like in the

first page of that chapter was already

creating a plot that was much nicer than

what I could have possibly created at

that time so we will see in this talk

that this is a recurring theme we have

very great tools that can help you to

create very nice outputs all from within

a couple of lines

okay so this is how I started ending up

with data visualization I wanted to

learn more and I kind of went down a

rabbit hole learn more about it and once

you start learning about data Vis you

see other people's work as well and here

I've brought a data Vis from John burn

Murdoch who's creating visualizations

from the financial times and if you

don't know his work you should

definitely check it out he creates

beautiful plots and what I found most

interesting about this particular chart

is that instead of using a legend like a

typical Legend on the right hand side of

the plot to indicate which color means

what instead it highlights single words

and colorizes them for example in a

title you can see that the word British

cities is colored in red and to indicate

that the red dots mean British cities so

I thought well can I do this in ggplot

to and so I set out and tried to create

a scatter plot first using the very

famous Palmer penguins and this is like

a very nice plot that I created with

ggplot it's a decent plot ggplot is a

very fancy tool to make these kind of

things but this was not what I set out

to do I wanted to have the colors not on

the right hand side but in the title so

the question is can we do this with NG

plot and the answer is yeah we can

actually do that but we have to invoke

an extra package that's called GG text

so at this point you are asking probably

okay what's the story with HTML and CSS

now right you we have been saying all of

this was done in R but if you are

looking at what you have to do to make

this happen even though we are using our

code what you need to do is to wrap the

words that you want to highlight into

these span Texs and inside of these span

Texs you have to set the color to some

hex code that you want to use so really

this is HTML and CSS these span Texs

that's HTML and the style instruction

inside of it that's CSS and even though

we could get very far to accomplish our

goal with just within R we have been

great tool for that we had to Sparkle in

a little bit of HTML and CSS to make

this happen and the very nice thing is

that it isn't actually that hard to make

this work right if you can create a

scatter plot with GG plot like that then

you certainly won't have any trouble to

set like the words into span text and

then throw in a couple of keywords and

we will see that this is a recurring

theme within with the tools that we like

to

use so I have mentioned that you can add

a little bit of HTML and CSS to your

data visualizations with ggplot but it's

also true for other very popular tools

and this is what I've noticed it's true

for tables with GT it's true for reports

and slides with qual and it's true for

dashboards that you create with shiny

all of these packages or tools are gr

out of the box they can they can create

beautiful outputs and we can get very

far all from within that tool that you

use but if you want to make something

unique if you want to make something a

little bit special like having the

colors in the title instead then you

need to add a little bit of HTML and CSS

to it I like to compare this to building

houses you can create or can build a

very nice a very solid home all with an

R nothing wrong about that but if you

want to add build something very special

want to have something very fancy then

you will you are kind of forced to add a

little bit of HTML and CSS to it but

really the point that I want to make

here is that just with the data

visualization where you only had to

throw in these span Texs it isn't that

hard once you at the point that you can

already create the nice home so the

transition using the HTML and CSS isn't

that

hard to prove my point let's look at a

couple more examples here's a table that

I have created with GT once again and

it's a very amazing tool that we have at

our disposal GT can make a very nice

table here it's a solid table it shows a

couple of measurements from the penguin

data set and it even has like a little

chart in there to visualize the

distribution of the penguin weights and

even though this is an neat table it may

be a bit boring it's just plain black

and white and you may need to draw your

reader's attention to that specific

table that you have so you might want to

throw in a little bit of color in there

add like a linear gradient to make

things look fancy just to grab your

reader attention and the same story is

here happening again basically this was

all done in GT but to make this happen

you created your table in R and then

passed this to some overlay in this case

it's called op CSS where you stick in

CSS code to make the final changes that

you want and again the story here is

that the part that is highlighted is

only a couple of keywords that are

pretty hard to pretty easy to understand

I I mean I will guess that you won't

have any trouble understanding what

border top with does when you set it to

one pixel right the only thing that may

might be a little bit Troublesome is the

things that are gr out here these are

the description of where you want to

apply your Styles but the cool thing

about this is that usually you don't

have to write these things yourself you

just have to figure out where to look

and then you copy and paste the thing

and throw that in there so this is how I

made this thing I mean I just copy and

pasted the descriptions and then I set

the keywords to what I want and the

keywords are easily Googled if you want

to figure out what changes the

background in CSS you Google just that

and you see that background will do the

job same thing is true in chiny in chiny

you can just throw in a couple of

keywords to a lot of UI elements to make

your user interface look different and

once you're comfortable with using these

nice and easy keyword value pairs you

can start to use more complex stuff from

CSS like the grid alignment to like take

your UI elements that you have from

within shiny and arrange that on a grid

here that's how I created the shiny app

this little habit tracker and basically

this is how I leverage CSS here to get

the job done and finally we have quto

which I like to call a web development

gateway

drug it it it really is true it's all a

quook generates so much great output for

you out of the box and a lot of times

that's HTML and CSS and then you're

thinking okay I want to change this tiny

thing to make the theme similar to what

I want and then you're like hooked you

want to like figure out how do I do this

and this is really how you end up

learning more about HTML and CSS and

this is how I ended up there too and the

very cool thing is that quo is a great

place to learn the HTML and CSS because

it already generates all of the code for

you you just have to figure out where to

look once you know that you can copy and

paste most of the code from there and

change the values to what you want if it

says background is white copy and paste

it and set background to Blue if that's

what you need so with that you can get

very far and the thing about quto is

that for example if you create slides

like these you can do things like in

little chunks for example you could

interpret every slide as a little web

development project and do some fancy

stuff there here I definitely want to

mention that this theme isn't by me it

is great but it is uh from Emil I

borrowed that he will speak about

probably more amazing quar of themes uh

just uh after me and this saying of

every slide is a little web development

project is something I have picked up

from Garrick Aden Buie who also stressed

this point so it's it's not an new idea

but it is worth repeating that you can

like start working on very small project

to easier way into the HTML and CSS

world so this backs the question how do

we actually start with that I gave you a

couple of examples and showed you like

after the fact this is how it was done

but how do we figure out these things

and again quto is the base for us our

users or qu to users it's the best way

to start out because most of the things

are already done for us and in this case

you can use so-called scss variables to

just throw in a scss so-called scss file

into your quter document set the theme

to that file it really is just a text

file that you rename to something

something. sccss and then you have an

scss file and in there you can use uh as

I said scss variables and set them to

very specific values this is this is

really the easiest way you can style a

lot of your qu to outputs by figuring

out what the couple of keywords are that

you want to use here the first three

keywords are the primary and secondary

and thary color and I've just set them

to some hex code and by just setting

this in this scss file you can

immediately transform the output of your

quoto file basically the theme is

changed then and the same thing could be

done for the code background or the code

chunk uh background color

and so on so you really have to figure

out what is the keyword that I need and

then you set it to some value and

thankfully the quter documentation is

pretty solid on that part you can just

go to the quter website look for the zus

variables scss and S are kind of the

same thing and there you will see the

most important variables and their names

are kind of

self-explanatory and then set that to

some value that you want so that's

basically the easy easy route to easier

way into HTML and CSS with Quon and once

you go want to go wild you once you

cannot do something with the basic scss

variables to make the changes that you

want then it becomes time to look at the

actual HTML and CSS code that quarter

generates for you and on any website you

can do this you can just take your web

browser write click

anywhere uh drop down menu will appear

and then you can navigate to inspect

just imagine that there is inspect and

not the German a word for it and then

you would uh know what you have to

click I deliberately not clicked inspect

right now because honestly this part is

scary once you open it up the web

developer view will immediately show up

and you will see a bunch of stuff you

will see the HTML all the CSS and a

thousand other tools I have never use or

I don't even know what they do honestly

but really it opens so many things and

you need need someone to kind of guide

you through it but once you have that

part the strategy to like make the

changes that you want to learn HTML and

CSS is pretty straightforward inspect

all the things that you want to change

this will immediately put you to the

HTML and CSS code that generates that

output copy and paste that stuff into

your scss

file and then simply change the values

to that what you need so as I said you

kind of need someone to guide you

through it you could of course try this

at home and just uh click inspect and

see what's happening but it's always

easy to have someone show you where to

look how it works and once that is done

it's like a 10minute intro then you know

how to operate with these three steps

but then it really is as easy as I've

said copy and paste most of the things

and add the values after the fact and

that's why I decided to actually make

such an introduction because because I

cannot do this here would make too much

would take too much time so this is why

uh you will find on YouTube a quarto

themes guide for HTML and CSS snoops

that guides you through that this is

actually part two part one will um show

you more details on the first part that

I have mentioned with the scss variables

so you can start with part one check out

how far you can go with there and then

use part two to see how much you can get

done with the we developer View and with

that thank you for coming for my talk

and I'm happy to answer any questions

that you

have thank you we have indeed time for

qu uh time for questions I was much

faster than I practiced so first

question have you dipped at all into

JavaScript for enhancing your

apps yeah but this is like a scary world

I I I mean I have dipped into it and it

is very very fascinating what you can do

um but I feel like the easier way to all

the things you want to change for style

HTML and CSS or

enough uh what are the limitations of

HTML and CSS in the r

context like if I can't ask questions

back I guess so I don't think there are

any limitations I mean basically all the

websites in the world that you see are

built on HTML and CSS and you can see

varieties of websites and I don't think

there's like imagination is the limit

for HTML and CSS I guess the only thing

that might be like in the r context be

specific is um for example the GG text

example it doesn't accept all style

instructions it only accepts those that

were implemented in that kind of

scenario there is truly is a limit then

you would have to figure like some heck

something out so the G so the GG text

output that works not only in HTML

output right so that output can be

that's any gig plot which you can save

into a PDF file I mean at the end it

generates a image file and the way that

you need to instruct to make the changes

is via HTML and CSS code I'm not 100%

sure what GG text does behind the scenes

with that instruction but you have to

use that language to instructed to do it

right right another question what is a

good way to share your new quarto themes

with others so I guess if you modify you

know a document maybe you want to do

that again to another document to use

the same theme or same style I mean

honestly we would share it I personally

would share it like I would share all

things via GitHub repository the slide

that I showed from Emil here that's how

I got it I knew Emil shared his themes

on cour on GitHub I just went there and

looked into this scss file and then put

that into my scss file so you just need

to share the scss files basically that's

the theme B basically and all the

resources that you want to have for

example in this very specific case there

are also images these are all images

then you also need the image file for

that of course thank you you're

[Applause]

welcome
